A reminder to myself of the values I want to live by.

## Core Values

### Be Authentic

It means not doing or wanting things just because everyone else does.

It means seeking only what I love and what I value the most.

### Be Humble

Ego is a trap. It offers a false sense of superiority. Comparing myself to others is a status game I cannot win—and it kills authenticity.

We never know the full answer. There is always something we don't know. You might be wrong at the same time you are right. 

Stop talking. Listen. Listen deeply.

### Be Curious

The world is messy. To understand it, we need multiple perspectives and disciplines.

Innovation comes from understanding the problem deeply. This requires a strong mental model of how the world actually works. We cannot solve what we do not understand.

### Be Patient

Respect time. Trust the power of compounding. 

### Be Empathetic

Great products require deep care for their users. Care requires empathy. 

Eventually, a large part of happiness in life cannot be found without others. And a lot of meaning comes from relationships with others.
