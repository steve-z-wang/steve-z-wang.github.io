A reminder to myself of the values I want to live by.

## Be Authentic

I can hardly live without authenticity anymore.

It means not wanting things — or trying to be something — just because everyone else is doing it.

It means seeking only what I love and what I value the most.

## Be Humble

Ego never helps. It tricks me into feeling good, making me think I am better than others. It is not true, and I need to always be alert to it.

We never know the full answer. There is always something we don't know.

Stop talking. Listen. Listen deeply.

## Be Curious

The real world is messy. To understand it, we need to see it from many different perspectives and through multiple disciplines.

Innovation comes from understanding the problem deeply. This requires a strong mental model of how the world actually works. We cannot solve what we do not understand.

## Be Empathetic

Great products come from deeply caring about the people who use them. Great care comes from empathy.
