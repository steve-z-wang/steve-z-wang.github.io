I've wanted to start a blog for a while.

Looking back, I've always had a need to create and share. I spent years with a camera—from high school through graduate school—learning to connect ideas and feelings into something unique. I loved explaining the story behind every shot.

In high school, I also loved writing. I remember the thrill of texting friends for feedback and taking a poetry class in my final year of college. It wasn't standard for a computer science student, but I loved the sessions where I could read my work aloud and hear how others responded.

Lately, that creative space has been filled by the noise of tech—AI, business models, and constant growth. It’s constant anxiety. I often send friends long, unstructured messages full of random thoughts. I figured it would be better to write them here.

## Writing as Thinking

I've found that if I consume too much without responding, it all becomes noise. 

One key idea from the book *Make It Stick* is that **recall makes for better learning**. Writing is a form of recall. When I explain an idea in my own words, I am forced to reconstruct the logic from scratch. This process is how thoughts truly stick. 

Humans are like AI models: we need to create output to train our brains to think clearly. Writing is the act of cleaning a messy room—it helps me see where every thought belongs and clears space for new ideas. It’s also a way to build leverage, turning a single thought into a permanent asset that can reach and connect with others.

Thanks for reading my first post. More to come soon.
