After a lot of reflection, I’ve decided to voluntarily leave Amazon and spend the next year (2025–2026) as a solo developer.

I’m deeply grateful for my time at Amazon—for the people I worked with, and for the opportunity to learn how to build, operate, and scale real systems in production. Working there taught me rigor, ownership, and what it truly means to ship software that runs at scale. I’ll carry those lessons with me wherever I go.

Over time, though, I realized I wanted something different.

## Why now

There are three reasons behind this decision.

1. AI has fundamentally changed what small teams — and even individuals — can build

We’re at a moment where a single developer can design, build, and ship products that previously required entire teams. AI doesn’t replace taste, judgment, or responsibility—but it dramatically lowers the cost of execution.

I want to fully explore what this new leverage enables, especially in consumer apps where speed, iteration, and empathy matter more than perfect optimization.

2. I want full ownership of what I build

Ownership isn’t just about equity. It’s about responsibility, direction, and learning.

I want to make product decisions end-to-end:
	•	What problem is worth solving
	•	How the product should feel
	•	What tradeoffs are acceptable
	•	What not to build

I’ve realized that I learn fastest—and care most deeply—when I’m fully accountable for the outcome.

3. I want to build toward a life with more long-term freedom

This isn’t about escaping hard work. If anything, this path will be harder and more uncertain.

But I want to invest my time in building assets—products, skills, and judgment—that compound over time. My goal is a life with more creative freedom, more agency, and more alignment between how I work and what I value.

## What I’ll be working on

Over the next year, I’ll be focused on building thoughtful, human-centered consumer apps.

Less optimization-obsessed.
Less metric-driven for the sake of metrics.
More soul. More care. More intentional design.

I have a few early ideas in mind, but I’m intentionally leaving space to explore, learn, and adjust. The path is uncertain—but I’m confident it will be meaningful and memorable.

This is one of the most important decisions I’ve made on my own so far.

## Gratitude

I also want to thank my family—especially my girlfriend and my mom.

Their support gave me the courage to take this step. Without their belief in me, this decision would have been much harder, if not impossible.

I don’t know exactly where this year will lead—but I’m excited to find out.
